Not on the Heraclitean Path
Memory is the art of forgetting.
It does not deal with reality, reality is not what engages it,
it has no substantial relation whatsoever to that inexpressible,
infinite complexity that is reality itself, in the same way and
to the same extent that we ourselves are unable to reach the point
where we can catch even a glimpse of this indescribable, infinite
complexity (for reality and glimpsing it are one and the same);
so the rememberer covers the same distance to the past about to be
evoked as that covered when this past had been the present, thereby
revealing that there had never been a connection to reality,
and this connection had never been desired, since regardless of the
horror or beauty that the memory evokes, the rememberer always works
starting from the essence of the image about to be evoked, an essence
that has no reality, and not even starting from a mistake, for he fails
to recall reality not by making a mistake, but because he handles what
is complex in the loosest and most arbitrary manner, by infinitely
simplifying the infinitely complex to arrive at something relative
to which he has a certain distance, and this is how memory is sweet,
this is how memory is dazzling, and this is how memory comes to be
heartrending and enchanting, for here you stand, in the midst of an
infinite and inconceivable complexity, you stand here utterly dumbfounded,
helpless, clueless, and lost, holding the infinite simplicity of the
memory in your hand plus of course the devastating tenderness of
melancholy, for you sense, as you hold this memory, that its reality
lies somewhere in the heartless, sober, ice-cold distance.
